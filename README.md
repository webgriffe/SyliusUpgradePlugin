## Requirements

* PHP `^8.0`
* Sylius `^1.11.2 || ^1.12`

## Installation

1. Run `composer require --dev webgriffe/sylius-upgrade-plugin`

2. Add the plugin to the `config/bundles.php` file:

    ```php
    Webgriffe\SyliusUpgradePlugin\WebgriffeSyliusUpgradePlugin::class => ['dev' => true, 'test' => true],
    ```

## Usage

All features are implemented as **console commands**.

### Template changes

    bin/console webgriffe:upgrade:template-changes <from-version> <to-version> [--theme=PATH_TO_YOUR_THEME] [--legacy] 

Print a list of template files (with extension .html.twig) that changed between two given Sylius versions and that have been overridden in your project: in root "templates" folder and/or in a custom theme.

You have to specify both the versions **from** and **to** you want to compute the changes.

There are two optional parameters:
* **--theme=PATH_TO_YOUR_THEME**, specify the theme folder in which to search for changed files. The path must be relative to the **kernel.project_dir** of your project. You can specify multiple themes by repeating the **--theme** parameter, see the related example in the proper section below;
* **--legacy**, use legacy theme folder structure. From v2.0 of the [SyliusThemeBundle](https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusThemeBundle/) the theme folder structure has changed. The old structure has been deprecated and will be removed in v3.0 as stated [here](https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusThemeBundle/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#upgrade-from-1x-to-20). 


#### Examples

* List of templates that changed between Sylius v1.8.4 and v1.8.8 and that were overridden in your root **templates** folder:

    ```bash
    bin/console webgriffe:upgrade:template-changes v1.8.4 v1.8.8
    ```

* List of templates that changed between Sylius v1.8.8 and v1.9.3 and that were overridden in your root **templates** folder and/or in your **my-website-theme** folder:

    ```bash
    bin/console webgriffe:upgrade:template-changes v1.8.8 v1.9.3 --theme=themes/my-website-theme
    ```

* Like the previous example, but it computes changes for multiple themes, one of which is in the vendor folder:

    ```bash
    bin/console webgriffe:upgrade:template-changes v1.8.8 v1.9.3 --theme=themes/my-website-theme --theme=themes/my-other-theme --theme=vendor/acme/my-vendor-theme
    ```

### Decorated services changes

    bin/console webgriffe:upgrade:service-changes <from-version> <to-version> [--theme=PATH_TO_YOUR_THEME] [--legacy] 

Print a list of services that changed between two given Sylius versions and that have been decorated/overridden in your project.

You have to specify both the versions **from** and **to** you want to compute the changes.

There are two optional parameters:
* **--namespace-prefix=NAMESPACE-PREFIX**, the first part of the namespace of your app services, like "App" in "App\Calculator\PriceCalculator". Default: "App".
* **--alias-prefix=ALIAS-PREFIX**, the first part of the alias of your app services, like "app" in "app.calculator.price". Default: "app".


#### Examples

* List of services that changed between Sylius v1.11.0 and v1.13.0 and that were decorated in your project:

    ```bash
    bin/console webgriffe:upgrade:service-changes v1.11.0 v1.13.0
    ```

* List of services that changed between Sylius v1.11.0 and v1.13.0 and that were decorated in your project but with custom namespace and alias prefixes:

    ```bash
    bin/console webgriffe:upgrade:service-changes v1.11.0 v1.13.0 --namespace-prefix="Webgriffe" --alias-prefix="webgriffe"
    ```
